# *Unhealthy Machines Breakdown - Real-Time Data Analytics Project*  

## *Project Overview*  
This project is a *real-time data analytics* initiative designed to monitor and analyze the breakdown of unhealthy machines across multiple production sites. By leveraging Tableau, the dashboard provides *actionable insights* to optimize predictive maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and improve operational efficiency.  

This type of data analytics solution is widely used in *consulting firms like Deloitte* to assist manufacturing clients in *root cause analysis, operational efficiency enhancement, and predictive maintenance planning*.  

## *Key Insights & Business Impact*  
âœ” *Identifies high-failure zones* to allocate maintenance resources efficiently.  
âœ” *Reduces downtime costs* by detecting failure trends early.  
âœ” *Enables data-driven decisions* for proactive machine health management.  
âœ” *Supports KPI tracking* to assess maintenance effectiveness across different sites.
